I included the class Diagram in my(Lauren Nandal) Assesment submission as I couldn't figure out how to add it here.

Report Part B:

In the test classes, if you provide a negative value for a port number it throws an error. The same this occurs if you try to use a null value for a user name. This occures since we currently do not have an exception handler for these cases. To fix these in the future we would have to add in an exception handler. Specifically we would have to do something like a retry entry.
